                            The SERVIR App Center is a dynamic inventory of applications developed under the SERVIR
                            Program, either by regional hubs and their partners, Applied Science Team (AST) projects
                            or the Science Coordination Office (SCO). The applications on the App Center can be
                            filtered by regions or by service areas to facilitate their discovery. The detail page
                            for each application presents technical information and credits to all parties involved
                            in their design, development and implementation. This inventory continues to grow as new
                            tools are developed.

                                In the spirit of supporting Open Science, SERVIR partners make the underlying code
                                for these apps available through public repositories. The information in this inventory
                                is maintained by the SERVIR SCO. The individual applications and their associated
                                datasets are maintained by their respective implementation teams.

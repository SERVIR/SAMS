                            The SERVIR App Center is a dynamic inventory of applications developed under the SERVIR
                            Program, either by regional hubs and their partners, Applied Science Team (AST) projects
                            or the Science Coordination Office (SCO). The applications on the App Center can be
                            filtered by regions or by service areas to facilitate their discovery. The detail page
                            for each application presents technical information and credits to all parties involved
                            in their design, development and implementation. This inventory continues to grow as new
                            tools are developed.

                                In the spirit of supporting Open Science, SERVIR partners make the underlying code
                                for these apps available through public repositories. The information in this inventory
                                is maintained by the SERVIR SCO. The individual applications and their associated
                                datasets are maintained by their respective implementation teams.

                            <p class="m10">Once there you will see a section header labeled APP. Under that are all the
                                data tables used to dynamically build the web page. These tables are where you will
                                maintain all the entries. From these tables most of your work will take place
                                within the Applications table. From there you can link to each of the other tables if
                                the desired entry exists or even add it if it doesn't exist.</p>
                            <p class="m10">Let's start with a simple add. Click the ADD APPLICATION button at the top right of the
                                screen. This opens a blank application form where you will fill out all the
                                information
                                about the application. When you get to Organization, if the organization for your
                                application does not exist in the dropdown simply click the + button next to the
                                dropdown, fill out the information for the new Organization, and click save.
                                This is true for all fields except Serviceareas and Deployment environment: (if you
                                believe you need to add to one of these please contact Francisco or Billy)</p>

                                App Center will do the best that it can to display the image you choose to upload for the
                                application, however every image is different, so if you try one and don't enjoy how it
                                displays, simple edit the application and upload a new one. If you need help resizing
                                an image for the best display feel free to reach out to one of us.

                                When you have added all the application information click save and your new
                                application will be added to the live site. Immediately check and confirm that it
                                is as you intended it to be, it's always good to have a second person read through
                                to help avoid any typos or mis-formatting.
